# IO
IO is a java library that enables secure multi-thread access to an I/O-source useful in the development of web, native and parallel computing communicating applications. This acces is strongly cached and high-performance, yet also wrapped in a thread-save and user-friendly layer, appropriate for the java ecosystem.

IO is an enabling technology and provides high-level abstraction for handling thread-save I/O-accesses. It is not a framework and remains minimal in functionality so there is little overhead to consider.

IO is open source software and freely available at no charge
